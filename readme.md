Module-3
For this module I was thinking making a website that will be selling shoes.

I added a navbar with 5 tabs that can send you to another page when clicked, 3 of those tabs will be active and working fine.
    -Two tabs on the navbar are avtive, Giveaway page & Gallery page.
        -Each of those pages has it's own content and different from the other pages
        -Giveaway page has a game that a user has to beat in order to get free shoes from us, the game is User vs AI
        -Gallery page has photos of shoes, and there is a another section that has unlimited shoes photos, it uses unsplash website API to get photos from there and display it on my website.

Under Navbar I added a body page that is showing a shoe image and a discription of the shoe with a buy button and that would be workable when clicked.
    -Update due to the deadline being close, I didn  not added a buy button for the product.

Under this container I have another container that shows 6 cards with a differnet shoe, with a discription and a buy button that will be workable when clicked.
     -Update due to the deadline being close, I didn  not added a buy button for the product.

At the bottom I've got a footer.
