Module-3
For this module I was thinking making a website that will be selling shoes.

I added a navbar with 5 tabs that can send you to another page when clicked, 3 of those tabs will be active and working fine.

Under Navbar I added a body page that is showing a shoe image and a discription of the shoe with a buy button and that would be workable when clicked.

Under this container I have another container that shows 6 cards with a differnet shoe, with a discription and a but button that will be workable when clicked.

Under this conatiner I am thinking of adding a footer, or maybe more containers that shows more content.
